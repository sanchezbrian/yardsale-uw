### Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

## Meeting Agenda:

## Last Week
This week we were able to polish up lost of final features that we wanted and needed to make our website ready to be an MVP. We were able to integrate UW SSO
through Google Authenctiation. This all works with the sign in process now, the flow still needs to change a small bit. We were also able to fiure out how to 
add images and display them and connect an image to a post on the backend. This was a huge milestone because it really puts the website well put together.
We were also able to make a new page where the user can see all of their posts they have for sale!

## This week

This week was great! We were able to finish up a great fully working website with all the features we needed and wanted for the final release. We were also able to create some more tests
so that we could have a test suite. Everything was able to come together very nicely to create a webiste we were happy and proud of.

We were able to take the peer review feedback and tweak some of our app flows and fix some of teh repo documentation to make it more user friendly.

We were even able to host our website on a public URL for any UW student to use! No need to keep running 'npm install' anymore if you are just a user!
