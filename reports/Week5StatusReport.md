### Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

## Meeting Agenda:
Discussing measures for proper testing. We found that its difficult to write unit tests for front end. Our project requires proper testing involved and the front end would usually involve visual testing only. For this reason, we were thinking it would be necessary to create a backend. We are familiar with how backend testing works and would be able to flush out a test suite for operations on the backend. Looking for advice about this.

Also, we noticed that a prototype of our project is due on May 10th. We wanted to get a clear picture of what exactly the requiremenets are so we can plan accordingly to deliver a satisfactory prototype by that date.

## Last Week
They're still some tasks from the previous week we haven't completed due to not finalizing what our MVP should be.
First, we are still ramping up with react and all made some progress into learning how to implement
this with our project. We will spend more time so we feel more confident once starting implementation for the frontend.
We also will need to complete the code architecture and the figmas of what we expect our screens to look like.
We contacted UW to get access to their UW SSO for our login authentication so we will have to wait for a response until then 
to start on this. 

- Finalize MVP
- Create Figmas
- Make code architecture
- Choose a database
- Prioritize frontend
- Have each group member choose a screen

This next week we are planning to talk much more about decding on what architecture we want to use with views, controllers, and models. We also plan to start importing
framkeworks and deciding on a build system to use. This will most likely be gradle.

## This week
This week we were able to make a huge amount of progress compared to the previous weeks. We were able to build an initial website with very limited features that we can now improve upon and show that we now have something working. Having this initial app skeleton is vital so that we all have a direction and vision of where we want to be and how we want to get there. We started off the week by creating our website in React and setting up the React enviorment. Through reasearch and tutorials we were able to come up with a very feature-limited but working website. As of now, our website is able to display products that are up for sale and also allows a user to create and post a new product for sale. Although we have not yet fully figured out how to authenticate a user this is great start to keep us moving and progressing. We also currently have set up a in-memory database through the front end so that we can mimich what it would be like once we are able to set up a dedicated backend. The way we are doing this is by creating a json file populated with mock data on our products. From here we use an imported module that creates a simple backend on our local machine where we can call REST API calls like get and post.

This week we also worked on coming up with an architecture for how we want our project to be orginized. This proved to be much more difficult than we anticipated. We were at a crossroad for quite a while on what architecture we wanted to have. From the videos nad tutorials we looked at to learn how to use React, it was not clear what architecture was best standard and practive to use with React. It seemed like most of what we saw with React, everything was jumbled up and there seemed to be no abstraction. In the end, we all agreed to use MCV (Model View Controller) architecture since this is what we were all most used to in the past when it came to web develpoment. There is still some research to do to make sure React allows for this architecture but so far it seems like this is possible using some frameworks like Redux potentially. We also are still figurinh out how to use the documenation that UW IT had sent involving implementing UW SSO authentication. This also proved to be harder to be that we had thought, but as we trial and error through it, hopfully we learn what else we need to contact UW IT even further so that they can help us with what comes with SSO authentication.

### GOALS FOR THE NEXT WEEK
With next week, we still are going to continue learning and improving with our knowledge with React. We're still in communication with UW IT to get access to the UW SSO login authenication, and we will most likely get everything sorted before the Thursday. If we do plan on doing a backend, there's going to be a lot of tasks for us to pick up on
