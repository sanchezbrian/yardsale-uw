### Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

## Last Week
Throughout this week, we worked on the requirements and policies homework assignment. We were able to outline our project in more depth 
and think about what use cases we were going to need. We were also able to think about what tool sets we were gonna use in more depth. 
We had some trouble figuring out exactly what backend provider we wanted to use to seem scalability and efficiency in mind which we will talk to our TA about. 
One part where we got stuck was we have a lot of ideas on what we want to do, but we still need a final idea of what we want MVP to be so we don’t overwork 
ourselves with the amount of time we’re given.
Our biggest goal next week is to make our repository. On top of this we also want to finalize and start making our code architecture. We also want to start thinking about the design for our website/app so we have a clear vision of where we are going. We have already made big milestones, but we also plan on breaking these bigger milestones into smaller tasks so that we can quickly progress through our project. We also hope to come up with a schema for our database to store information needed like user profiles, items for sale, etc. On top of this, we have to choose which database server we will use.

## This week
This week, we were able to dive deeper into what a functional MVP would look like. We decided to make our chat system a stretch goal as we are just gonna provides buyers
and sellers with their email. We thought this was valid to do as we want to focus on the bare bones and meat of what we want our app to be. We were able to come up with
much clearer milestones after talking about what exactly we want our MVP to contain. We also came up with a much clearer way on how we are going to get progress
completed with our project. We decided that we are first going to tackle the front-end tasks first before worrying about the backend implementation. Since most of our
website will be front-end and how a user interacts, this will be the best approach. We are going to focus on seperate screen and have each person work on a different
screen. We also came up with our initial backend schema and how that would look. We were also able to figure out the collection of API endpoints we are gonna need
to get, post, and update data in our backend.

We had some trouble this week figuring out what should be included in our initial MVP since we thought what we had come up with was too little.
We realized it was ulimately ok with we ended up with. This is because we had a great outline of what we want our website to have in the simplest form while
also targeting the biggest features that truly make up what this project is. \

### GOALS FOR THE NEXT WEEK
They're still some tasks from the previous week we haven't completed due to not finalizing what our MVP should be.
First, we are still ramping up with react and all made some progress into learning how to implement
this with our project. We will spend more time so we feel more confident once starting implementation for the frontend.
We also will need to complete the code architecture and the figmas of what we expect our screens to look like.
We contacted UW to get access to their UW SSO for our login authentication so we will have to wait for a response until then 
to start on this. 

- Finalize MVP
- Create Figmas
- Make code architecture
- Choose a database
- Prioritize frontend
- Have each group member choose a screen

This next week we are planning to talk much more about decding on what architecture we want to use with views, controllers, and models. We also plan to start importing
framkeworks and deciding on a build system to use. This will most likely be gradle.

### Contributions of individual team members.
This week after we got together most of last weeks individual tasks were changed quite a bit after we talked about what we actuially wanted to have in our MVP and deciding
to focus on the front-end much more than the back end. This week we all were able to get together and collaborate wvery well on dive depper into what we need to work on\
to have a fully functional MVP. We also came together to finish the git setup and talk about our file structire and how we were gonna seperate the front and backend.
