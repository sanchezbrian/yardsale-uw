###Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).
Throughout this week, we worked on the requirements and policies homework assignment. We were able to outline our project in more depth 
and think about what use cases we were going to need. We were also able to think about what tool sets we were gonna use in more depth. 
We had some trouble figuring out exactly what backend provider we wanted to use to seem scalability and efficiency in mind which we will talk to our TA about. 
One part where we got stuck was we have a lot of ideas on what we want to do, but we still need a final idea of what we want MVP to be so we don’t overwork 
ourselves with the amount of time we’re given.
Our biggest goal next week is to make our repository. On top of this we also want to finalize and start making our code architecture. We also want to start thinking about the design for our website/app so we have a clear vision of where we are going. We have already made big milestones, but we also plan on breaking these bigger milestones into smaller tasks so that we can quickly progress through our project. We also hope to come up with a schema for our database to store information needed like user profiles, items for sale, etc. On top of this, we have to choose which database server we will use.

### Contributions of individual team members.
Everyone contributed in completing the requirement and policies homework assignment. We all got together and discussed what toolsets to use, came up with our initial milestones and each of us came up with a use case.
